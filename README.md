## What I learned
Got a better grasp on how to properly use wordpress and PHP.
I can grasp how AJAX & REST API works. 
Better understanding on the structure of Wordpress hierarchy.
Finally understand how to properly target and style things for wordpress.

## What I want to work on?
Make use of more SASS variables & understanding AJAX in wordpress enough to make use of it in future projects.

## Final Notes
This project feels like it should be before Inhabitent. I got a stronger grasp on how to target CSS, and the hierarchy of wordpress after finishing this one.
